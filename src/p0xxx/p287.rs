        // the 0-th index is one of the special positions where no other node pointing to them.
        // They will meet somewhere in a loop
        //
        // In general, the path they travel look like:
        // S ---> X ---> M --> X
        // S is the starting point (the index 0)
        // X is the duplicate number or the index pointed by two or more nodes
        // M is the index where they meet.
        //
        // L = the length from S to X
        // C = the length of the loop
        // m = the length from X to M
        //
        // Hare travel distance is: H = L + h * C + m, for some integers h.
        // Tortoise distance is: T = L + t * C + m, for some integers t.
        // Since hare moves fast, we have H = 2 * T
        // Simplify the equation, we have (h - t) * C = L + m
        //
        // This means the L + m is a multiple of loop length!
        // or, if one of them moves more L steps, it would reach X, which is the duplicate.
        //
        // So what is L? We dont need to know.
        // Ask the other back to the beginning, the zero position, and steps L times
        // They will meet again where is the duplicate.
